# Vessel Mechanic Log V.2  

## Overview  
Version 2 of the Vessel Mechanic Log is a **read-only** system, allowing users to reference vessel data and specifications. This lightweight version is designed to run on **IPFS** without requiring a traditional server to fetch or push data.  

## Features  
- 📄 **Read-Only Access** – Users can view vessel data but cannot modify it.  
- ⚡ **Lightweight** – Optimized for speed and minimal resource usage.  
- 🌐 **Decentralized** – Fully functional on **IPFS** and **GitHub Pages**, no backend required.  

## How It Works  
- Data is stored in **JSON files** inside the repository.  
- The web page dynamically loads data based on user Vessel selection.
